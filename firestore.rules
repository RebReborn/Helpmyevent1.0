/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes strong authorization controls while relaxing data validation to enable rapid prototyping.
 * It enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data and allows public read access for certain collections with owner-controlled writes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User-specific data is nested under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Publicly readable data (e.g., posts) resides in top-level collections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Read-only collections are not explicitly defined, erring on the side of caution.
 * - Data validation is minimal, focusing only on authorization-critical fields.
 * - A fallback rule is included for prototyping purposes to avoid "missing or insufficient permissions" errors. REMOVE IN PRODUCTION.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Events nested under `/users/{userId}/events/{eventId}` include the `userAccountId` within the event document,
 *   enabling security rules to validate ownership without additional `get()` calls.
